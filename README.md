# Data Scientist Roadmap

Welcome to the **Data Scientist Roadmap** repository! This guide provides a structured pathway to mastering data science, covering essential knowledge and tools you'll need on your journey to becoming a data scientist.

## Overview

This roadmap is organized into stages, guiding you from foundational knowledge to advanced techniques. Each stage focuses on critical skills, tools, and methodologies necessary for a successful data science career.

## Roadmap Structure

1. **Basic Foundations**
   - **Mathematics**: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, and Statistics.
   - **Programming**: Focus on Python, with optional R.
   - **Data Manipulation**: Libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Dplyr (R).
   - **Data Visualization**: Libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and ggplot2 (R).

2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning, Handling Missing Data, and Data Scaling/Normalization.

3. **Machine Learning**
   - **Supervised Learning**: Regression (e.g., Linear and Polynomial Regression) and Classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, k-NN, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
   - **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical) and Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).
   - **Reinforcement Learning**
   - **Model Evaluation and Validation**: Cross-validation, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Model Selection.
   - **ML Libraries**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch.

4. **Deep Learning**
   - Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, LSTM, GRU, and GANs, covering applications in image classification, object detection, time series forecasting, and language modeling.

5. **Big Data Technologies**
   - Hadoop (HDFS, MapReduce), Spark (RDDs, DataFrames, MLlib), and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase, Couchbase).

6. **Data Visualization and Reporting**
   - Tools for building dashboards (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Dash, Shiny) and storytelling with data.

7. **Domain Knowledge and Soft Skills**
   - Industry-specific knowledge, problem-solving, communication, time management, and teamwork.

8. **Staying Updated and Continuous Learning**
   - Recommended resources: online courses, books, blogs, podcasts, conferences, and community engagement.
